# Welcome to CUEH ComSec
Hello and welcome to Comsec, Coventryâ€™s unofficial ethical hacking society; meeting every Wednesday at 2pm during term time. We hold lectures (with live demonstrations and challenges), meet with industry leaders and businesses and compete in international CTFs.

Currently the CTF teams operate with the aliases 'Ethical Slackers' or 'R0073R5'. We participate in a number of university CTFs such as [pwnEd](https://pwned.sigint.mx/) (9/45) and the [Hack The Box Uni CTF](https://www.hackthebox.com/universities/university-ctf-2021) (33/594), as well as global CTFs such as picoCTF and RuCTFe.

## Committee
As a society we are fairly open and will allow anyone to run sessions - as we are all good at different areas. However, to ensure that the club runs smoothly, it is led by the following people:

- Jack Orcherton
- Ben Roxbee Cox
